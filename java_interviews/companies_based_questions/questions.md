That is a very accurate observation. The pool of questions for service-based companies (TCS, Infosys, Wipro, Accenture, Capgemini, Cognizant, etc.) is indeed finite and highly repetitive. Mastery of these ~200 specific patterns guarantees you can solve almost any variation they throw at you.

Here is the **Master List of 200 Coding Questions**, categorized by topic and difficulty.

### **How to Use This List:**

1. **Don't Panic:** You don't need to memorize the code for all 200.
2. **Pattern Recognition:** Questions 1-25 are all "Loop + Modulo" logic. Questions 26-40 are all "Array Traversal" logic.
3. **The 80/20 Rule:** 80% of interview questions come from the first **100 questions** in this list. The last 50 are for higher packages.
