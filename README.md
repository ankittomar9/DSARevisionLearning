# DSA Revision Of Questions Done

This repository contains Java solutions and notes for data structures and algorithms (DSA) problems used for focused revision and interview preparation.

## Purpose
- Collect and organize solved problems with clear explanations.
- Provide a structured study plan to revise core DSA topics efficiently.
- Offer contribution guidelines so others can add problems, explanations, and tests.

## Repository structure
- src/ or problems/: Java solution files organized by topic (e.g., arrays, linkedlist, trees, graphs, dp, sorting)
- notes/: Explanations, approaches, and complexity analysis (if present)
- tests/: Unit tests or sample inputs and outputs (if present)
- README.md: This file
- CONTRIBUTING.md: Guidelines for contributing

## How to use
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/ankittomar9/DSARevisionLearning.git
2. Browse problems by folder to find topic-specific solutions.
3. Compile and run Java files (example):
   javac src/path/ProblemName.java
   java src.path.ProblemName

Note: Adjust the commands to your project layout if using packages or a build tool (Maven/Gradle).

## Study plan (8-week structured plan)
This plan is tailored for busy learners who want a focused revision schedule. Adjust pacing as needed.

Week 1 — Fundamentals & Arrays
- Day 1: Review time/space complexity, Big-O refresher
- Day 2-3: Arrays — two pointers, sliding window, prefix sums
- Day 4-5: Practice 8-12 array problems (easy → medium)
- Day 6-7: Mini mock: 2 timed problems

Week 2 — Strings & Hashing
- Day 1-2: String manipulation techniques, pattern matching
- Day 3-4: Hash tables, frequency counters
- Day 5-7: Practice string + hashing problems

Week 3 — Linked Lists & Stacks/Queues
- Day 1-2: Singly/doubly linked list operations, fast-slow pointers
- Day 3-4: Stack & Queue patterns (monotonic stack, BFS queue usage)
- Day 5-7: Practice problems + implement common templates

Week 4 — Trees & Binary Search Trees
- Day 1-2: Tree traversals, recursion templates
- Day 3-4: BST operations, balanced trees concepts
- Day 5-7: Problem set focused on trees (DFS/BFS)

Week 5 — Heaps, Sorting & Searching
- Day 1-2: Heaps (priority queues), top-K patterns
- Day 3-4: Sorting algorithms and binary search patterns
- Day 5-7: Practice top-k and sorting-related problems

Week 6 — Graphs
- Day 1-2: Graph representations, BFS/DFS templates
- Day 3-4: Shortest paths, topological sort, components
- Day 5-7: Practice graph problems (medium → hard)

Week 7 — Dynamic Programming
- Day 1-3: DP basics, memoization, tabulation
- Day 4-7: Practice common DP patterns (knapsack, LIS, partition)

Week 8 — Mock Interviews & Review
- Day 1-3: Timed problems across topics
- Day 4-5: Review weak areas and revisit notes
- Day 6-7: Final mock interviews (pair or solo)

Daily routine suggestions
- Warmup: 15–30 minutes reading templates and notes
- Problem solving: 60–90 minutes focused practice
- Reflection: 15–30 minutes write-up of the approach and complexity
